##  Build Instructions

### 1. Open the MSYS2 Terminal
Make sure you open the **MSYS2 UCRT64** terminal, not MSYS or MINGW32.  
You can verify this by running:
echo $MSYSTEM
It should display:
UCRT64

---

### 2. Build the Project
To compile the entire project, simply run:
mingw32-make
Or, if your system recognizes the command as 'make', you can use:
make

---

### 3. Output
After successful compilation, the executable will be generated as:
./main.exe
If you are using a custom Makefile, the output file may have a different name, such as:
./proyecto-ajedrez.exe

---

### 4. Run the Executable
You can execute the compiled program with:
./main.exe
or (depending on the output file name):
./proyecto-ajedrez.exe

---

### 5. Notes
- Ensure all `.cpp` and `.h` files are located in the correct `src/` and `include/` folders as expected by the Makefile.  
- You must have **g++** installed in the UCRT64 environment. If not, install it using:
  pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc
